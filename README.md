Data Loading and preprocessing is one of the most significant parts of a deep-learning training pipeline. Hence converting raw data into relevant formats which are readable and fitting to varying state-of-the-art computer vision based architecture is tedious and difficult to grasp. Mostly to people new to the domain. Hence this repo is intended to provide assistance in data-loading and preprocessing tasks, while simultaneously providing descriptions to the the functions and methods being used and addressing the necessity of use.
